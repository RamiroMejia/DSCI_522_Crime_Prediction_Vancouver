# Exploratory data analysis of Crimes in Vancouver data set

# Summary of the data set

The data set used in this project comes from the Vancouver Police Department Open Data [@Data]. Each row in the data set represents a reported crime in Vancouver, including crime type, date (in year, month, day, hour, minute), block address, and neighbourhood name. The data set covers cases from 2003 to 2021 of a total of 782,749 cases. For the visualization purpose, we focus on the past ten years' data here (from 2011 to 2021).
Below we show the number of reported crimes for each neighbourhoods. Note there are 24 neighbourhoods in Vancouver.

# Data split into training and test sets

Data is split in a way that 80% observations are in the training data set and 20% are for testing. Below we list the counts of observations of both classes:

We will now further investigate the training data set on its trends and correlations.

# Explorary analysis on the training data set

First, we explore the type of crimes to see if a certain crime is in our best interest. From below distribution of crime types, over 50% of crimes are theft from vehicle and other theft.

Figure 1. Crimes in Vancouver in the past 10 years

If we look at how the crimes evolved over the past ten years, we can see that the crime cases level is relatively stable from 2011 to 2018. However, there's a steep increase in 2018 where theft from vehicles surpassed other theft and became the most common crime type in Vancouver. This may be due to the start of Covid that causes a series of social problems. However, the data set does not provide more insights into the reasons, and this is not the focus of this project.

To view where most observations lie and the correlation between neighbourhood and types of crime, we plot the categorical groups with the correlation plot as below. We can see that data concentrate on some categorical groups. For example, a high volume of thefts (both from vehicles and others) are reported at Arbutus Ridge Neighbourhood. This indicates that there can be some relationships between types of crime and neighbourhoods.

Below you can find the top 5 neighbourhoods with the most reported crime cases, which suggests that crimes are more likely to happen in certain neighbourhoods.
